            Z3r0 is intended for authorized security assessment, code auditing,
            internal review, controlled research, and training environments. Network access,
            sandbox containers, terminal access, file management, and model
            credentials should remain isolated and trusted. Users must define and
            follow an explicit authorization scope before using any tool capability.
